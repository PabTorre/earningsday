      "\n",
      " \n",
      "For this example we will focus on event item 3.02. On the production version we will allow the user to choose the filings to search. \n",
      "\n",
      "### CIK Codes\n",
      "\n",
      "The fillings are indexed using the CIK codes, for this example we will use a fixed CIK code, for the production version we will map the tickers to the CIK code through the company name. \n",

      "\n",
      "EDGAR provides FTP access to all of their files. \n",
      "There are over 13 million filings available in their site, so downloading them all is not practical for now. \n",
      "They also provide a \"masters\" file that contains an index of all the filings in the FTP. \n",
      "We will download the complete index from EDGAR and use it to provide search options to the user. \n",
      "This masters file can be updated using daily update files, also provided by the EDGAR FTP site. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Processing the data. \n",
      "\n",
      "The data from EDGAR is not tidy, it comes in HTML format that is not suitable for machine reading out of the box. \n",
      "In order to process the data, we: \n",
      "    1. cleaned the document to remove all HTML tags and leave only the content. \n",
      "    2. used regex to extract the item names contained in each form. \n",
      "    3. used regex to extract the full text of each item. \n",
      "    4. index the full text to the item name into database. \n",
      "## Displaying the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our first version we will display the results as formated text so the user can extract the content out of the filings and read only the items that he is interested in reading. \n",
