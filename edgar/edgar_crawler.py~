EDGAR_CRAWLER


This program is designed to extract information from the SEC's EDGAR documents
The objective is to build a software that allows a user to enter a stock
symbol and get fundamental information from the filings made by that company.


### EDGAR
  EDGAR is a web portal where the SEC makes corporate fillings available

  http://www.sec.gov/edgar/quickedgar.htm

### Notes


Searches can be narrowed down by dates.

Types of search supported:


  - FULL text search:
      - goes  over the last 4 years of fillings and attachments.
  - Current Events Analysis:
      - goes over fillings made during the previous week.
      - this allows you for example to search for all 10K (anual)
        or 10Q (quaterly) fillings made in the last week.


### FTP access

  EDGAR supports FTP access

  http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/ftpusers.htm

  - To use anonymous FTP to access the EDGAR FTP server, use your
    FTP software to connect to ftp://ftp.sec.gov and
    log in as user "anonymous,"
    using your electronic mail address as the password.

  #### Available Index types:

  Four types of indexes are available:

  - company — sorted by company name

  - form — sorted by form type

  - master — sorted by CIK number

  - XBRL —  list of submissions containing XBRL financial files,
            sorted by CIK number;
            these include Voluntary Filer Program submissions

  Indexes are located in the following folders
    according to time period indexed:

    - /edgar/daily-index — daily index files through the current year;
      previous year folders are available through 1994Q3

    - /edgar/full-index — year folders contain quarterly indexes.
      Full indexes offer a "bridge" between Quarterly and Daily indexes,
      compiling filings for the previous business day through the beginning of
      the current quarter.


  - Feed and Oldloads Folders

  Feed — The Feed directory contains a tar and gzip archive file
        e.g., 20061207.nc.tar.gz;
        nc stands for non-cooked) for each filing day.
        Each filing compressed in the tar is a separate filing submission.
